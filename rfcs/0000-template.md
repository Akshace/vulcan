# Summary

Brief explanation of the feature.

# Basic example

Include a basic code example/link to an existing proof-of-concept, if applicable.
This could demonstrate installation/usage of the new feature with other
service components.

# Motivation

What project requirements or use cases does it support?

Outline the problem you are trying to solve so that if this RFC is not accepted,
the motivation could be used to develop alternative solutions.

# Detailed design

This is the bulk of the RFC. Explain the design in enough detail for somebody
familiar with the project to understand, and for somebody familiar with the
implementation to implement. This should get into specifics and corner-cases,
and include examples of how the feature is used. Any new terminology should be
defined here.

# Drawbacks

Why should we *not* do this? Please consider:

- implementation cost, both in term of code size and complexity
- whether the feature can be implemented and run on all targeted systems
(if you use non-standard libraries)
- if the proposal is aligned with the other requirements of the project

There are tradeoffs to choosing any path. Attempt to identify them here.

# Alternatives

What other designs have been considered? What is the impact of not doing this?

# Unresolved questions

Optional, but suggested for first drafts. What parts of the design are still
TBD?
